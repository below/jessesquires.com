### How I work

I have [a decade of experience]({% link linkedout.md %}) developing for Apple platforms. Depending on your company's needs, I'm available to build entire iOS apps from scratch, explore new ideas with quick prototypes, work on new features or fixes for existing apps, and everything in-between. I value clear, direct, proactive communication and getting things done right. With my breadth and depth of experience, I can build solutions efficiently and effectively, always adhering to industry best practices.

I typically work with open-ended contracts at an hourly rate. However, I am open to working for a flat rate for fixed-length projects. Let me know what you are looking for and we can figure out what works best. Depending on the nature and scope of the project and your budget, rates are negotiable. I am based in Oakland, CA and most often working in the Pacific time zone, although I sometimes travel while working.
