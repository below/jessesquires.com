title: Mac menu bar apps for sale
---

My Mac menu bar apps, [Red Eye](https://www.hexedbits.com/redeye/) and [Lucifer](https://www.hexedbits.com/lucifer/), are now for sale on my new [Gumroad store](https://hexedbits.gumroad.com).

Previously, these were free downloads on [my apps website](https://www.hexedbits.com). If you currently have them installed, nothing will change for you. They will keep working. However, if you have ever been helped by [one of my blog posts]({% link archive-home.html %}), enjoyed [one of my conference talks]({% link speaking.md %}), or used [one of my open source libraries]({{ site.data.social.github }}), then buying these apps is a great way to support my work!

I have listed them both for $2, but Gumroad allows you to pay more if you like --- similar to artists selling albums on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com). I realize it's a lot to ask you to pay for something that has been free until now, but your support is very much appreciated! And if you are able to leave a rating, that would also be great.

You might be wondering, _why now?_ Well, I am trying to get more serious about monetization and experimenting with some different sales and distribution models _outside_ of the Mac App Store. Since [going independent]({% post_url 2023-04-10-going-indie %}), I have been financially supported primarily through freelance and contracting work. My goal is to start shifting more of my income towards my indie apps and away from freelance gigs. With these tiny menu bar apps on Gumroad, I'm dipping my toes in the water. Also, I find _selling something_ to be a bit more compelling than simple donations like [GitHub Sponsors]({{ site.data.github.sponsor }}) as a way of supporting someone. (Although, if you would like to sponsor me on GitHub, that would be great too!)

More importantly, I have another Mac app that I'm planning to release this year --- _not on the Mac App Store_. I likely _will not_ be selling and distributing that via Gumroad. I'm currently looking into [FastSpring](https://fastspring.com) and [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com) to determine which is a better fit. We'll see how it all works out!
