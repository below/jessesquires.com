title: Top posts of 2023
---

To continue my (almost) tradition of sharing my top posts, here are my most popular posts of 2023. You can find previous years [here under the #top-posts tag]({{ "top-posts" | tag_url }}). Last year, 2022, is notably absent from this series --- I was too burnt out last year (for a number of reasons) to write one of these posts. So as a bonus, I'll include my top posts of 2022 here as well! As usual, all of my analytics data is [publicly available]({{ site.stats_url }}), made possible by the excellent [GoatCounter Analytics](https://www.goatcounter.com), so you can view it too.
