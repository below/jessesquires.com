title: A list of books I read in 2023
---

Continuing another tradition, here are the books I read in 2023. Similar to my [previous post]({% post_url 2023-12-29-top-posts-of-2023 %}) highlighting my top posts of 2023, I also skipped publishing my reading list last year, for 2022. Again, I was simply too burnt out by the end of that year. I also did not read that much compared to previous years --- thanks again to burnout. You can find previous years [here under the #reading-list tag]({{ "reading-list" | tag_url }}).

<!--excerpt-->

Since I skipped last year, I'll include everything for 2022 and 2023 in this list. As usual, these are in no particular order but I've grouped books by the same author together.

- *The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love*, by bell hooks
- *Bone Black*, by bell hooks
- *All About Love: New Visions*, by bell hooks
- *Night Sky with Exit Wounds*, by Ocean Vuong
- *Time Is a Mother*, by Ocean Vuong
- *Happy-Go-Lucky*, by David Sedaris
- *The Hidden Life of Trees*, by Peter Wohlleben
- *War and Peace in Kurdistan*, by Abdullah Öcalan
- *Liberating Life: Woman's Revolution*, by Abdullah Öcalan
- *Arabian Love Poems*, by Nizar Qabbani
- *Salt Houses*, by Hala Alyan
- *How to Be an Antiracist*, by Ibram X. Kendi

Hopefully, I can get back into a better reading routine for 2024.
