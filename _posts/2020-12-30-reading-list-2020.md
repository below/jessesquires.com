title: A list of books I read in 2020
---

Continuing my (still somewhat recent) tradition, here are the books I read in 2020. You can find previous years [under the #reading-list tag]({{ "reading-list" | tag_url }}). I really thought I was going to be able to read *a lot* more this year, but fuck this pandemic and fuck 2020 all around. There were many weeks where I simply could not focus on much of anything.

<!--excerpt-->

Still, I read 15 books in total, which isn't bad. However, I had planned on reading about double that amount. Ha! I guess my list is set for 2021, which I hope will be much less of a fucking disaster.

So, here we go. I have grouped books by the same author, but these are otherwise in no particular order. The links go directly to the publishers' or authors' websites (where possible), because fuck Amazon. I hope you discover something new!
